  <p>
    I am Wenxuan Xu, a graduate student at <a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth College</a>. My primary focus is on selection methods, user behavior modeling in Virtual Reality. 
    I also casually dabble in rendering—but I'm pro at League of Legends.
  </p>
  <p>
    I earned my bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</a> (XJTLU). 
    During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to work for two years in the X-CHI Lab
    under the direct supervision of Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UJPH5ioAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Hai-Ning Liang</a>. 
    Additionally, I served as a research intern in the <a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank">PI Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">Tsinghua University</a>, 
    mentored by Professor <a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/en/" target="_blank">Yuntao Wang</a>. 
    I also collaborated closely with Professor <a href="https://vvise.iat.sfu.ca/people/wolfgang-stuerzlinger" target="_blank">Wolfgang Stuerzlinger</a> from <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a> (SFU).
    We continue to work together closely to this day.
