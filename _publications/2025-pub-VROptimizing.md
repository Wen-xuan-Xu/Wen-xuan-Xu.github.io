  Proximity-based feedback provides users with real-time guidance as they approach an interaction goal. This type of feedback is par ticularly useful for tasks that require guidance during the interac tion process, such as selecting moving targets. This work explores proximity-based feedback types and modalities to improve the se lection of moving targets in VR by leveraging three feedback types that combine visual, auditory, and haptic modalities. We evalu ated the performance of these mechanisms through two user stud ies, analyzing both objective data (e.g., selection time, error rate) and subjective data (e.g., user experience, preferences) to explore the characteristics of feedback types across different modalities and to examine the roles of various modalities within multimodal com binations. Our findings suggest optimal selection mechanisms for developers and should be tailored to different goals: achieving user precision, enabling quick movement to a target, considering task duration, and enhancing entertainment value. We also discuss ap plications that correspond to these different perspectives.
